# Stopwatch
Stopwatch in HTML is a web-based timer tool built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. It typically includes a display area to show elapsed time and buttons to start, stop, and reset the timer. JavaScript handles the logic by using functions like setInterval to update the time display at regular intervals.
